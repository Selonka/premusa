This tool creates a site-only-AF.vcf for the Off-label workflow to simply call differences in two samples with Mutect2.
For details of this workflow look at:https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog?id=11315

WDL-> Workflow starts from the vcf of the unfiltered Mutect2.output.

Hope this tool helps people to stop messing arround with excel-files ;)
